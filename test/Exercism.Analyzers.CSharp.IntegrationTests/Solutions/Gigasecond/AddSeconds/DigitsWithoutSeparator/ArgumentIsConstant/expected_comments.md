[COMMENT #1]
Consider writing `1000000000` as `1e9` or `1_000_000_000`.

[COMMENT #2]
As the `Add` method only has a single statement, consider converting the method to an [expression-bodied method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members#methods).
